Subject: Database Connection and Data Extraction Script Completion

Dear [Manager's Name],

I have completed the implementation of the database connection and data extraction script. The script takes the DSN as a parameter, appends it to the URL, retrieves the response, and uses the extracted details to establish a database connection. The data is then stored in a designated directory.

Script Details:

Script Path: /path/to/your/script/db_instance_fetch.py

Functionality: Connects to the database using URL response details and extracts data.

DSN Input: Passed as a parameter during script execution.

Output File Location:

Directory: /npd/staging/fetch_monet_db_details/

Output files
